# How to Automate Data Migration to Webflow CMS: A Practical Guide
This project demonstrates how to automate the process of migrating data to Webflow CMS using the Webflow API. It provides a practical example of syncing new and updated items with a Webflow collection, handling retries for API operations, and ensuring data consistency.

## Overview
Migrating data to Webflow CMS manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates the process by:
- Fetching existing items from a Webflow collection.
- Comparing them with new data to determine which items need to be created or updated.
- Using the Webflow API to perform create, update, and publish operations with retry logic.

This guide is designed to help developers understand how to structure and implement a data migration workflow for Webflow CMS.

---

## Features
- **Automated Syncing**: Automatically syncs new and updated items to a Webflow collection.
- **Retry Logic**: Handles API rate limits and retries failed operations.
- **Type Safety**: Uses TypeScript for clear and maintainable code.
- **Modular Design**: Organized project structure for easy customization and scalability.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)
PNPM (or another package manager like npm or yarn)
A Webflow account with API access
A .env file with your Webflow API key

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/webflow-integration.git
cd webflow-integration
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pnpm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Webflow API key:
WEBFLOW_API_KEY=your_webflow_api_key

4. Update the constants in collection.ts and items.ts with your Webflow collection ID and the data to be migrated.

---

## Usage
Run the script to start the data migration process:
```
pnpm run dev
```

The script will:

- Fetch existing items from the specified Webflow collection.
- Compare them with the new data provided in items.ts.
- Create or update items in the Webflow CMS as needed.
- Check the console output for a summary of the migration process, including the number of items created, updated, and any errors encountered.

---

## How It Works
1. Environment Setup
The environment.ts file loads environment variables from the .env file, ensuring the Webflow API key is available throughout the application.

2. Webflow API Client
The client.ts file initializes the Webflow API client using the provided API key.

3. Fetching Existing Items
The fetch.ts file contains logic for retrieving existing items from the specified Webflow collection.

4. Syncing Items
The syncItems.ts file compares the existing items with the new data and determines which items need to be created or updated. It uses the functions in operations.ts to perform the necessary API operations.

5. Retry Logic
The project uses retry logic to handle API rate limits and transient errors, ensuring that all operations are completed successfully.
